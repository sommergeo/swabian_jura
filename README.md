### Print map
This print map measures 120x80 mm at 300 dpi, which is suitable for printing on a ISO-A4 page in portrait orientation. If your computer screen has a standard resolution of 96 dpi, you see this map roughly in original size. Topography is represented by a Diercke-style elevation with both analytical and combined hillshading. Types are in Open Sans 6-8pt. Only the Danube and relevant rivers are labeled.
